# Cellular Automata

I was enticed to begin playing with cellular automata by the fact that they can generate the Sierpinski triangle. I look forward to exploring more patterns that might emerge from rules even simpler than those that underpin Conway's Game of Life.

Thanks to Daniel Shiffman's [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/) for inspiring this animation. His chapter on cellular automata breathed the idea into me, but I developed the code myself.
